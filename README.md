Functionalities:
--> As a professor i can define an activity at a particular date, with a description  and a unique access code for the activity. The activity is accessible for a set period of time.

--> As a student who has accessed an activity i have access to an interface split into 4 rectagles each containing an emoticon (smiley face, frowny face, surprised face, confused face). At any time i can press an emoticon to react to the activity. As a student i can add an unlimited number of feedback instances.

--> As a professor i can see the continuous feedback stream, with each feedback instance associated to the time it was generated at. I can only see the feedback as anonymous. For myself the feedback is available both during and after the activity.
